Before this experience, I had never used any of these tools before. However, creating a README.md and LICENSE.md has been a very educational and eye-opening process. I learned how important these files are in setting up projects properly. The README file helps to explain what the project is about, while the LICENSE file protects the work and shows how it can be used by others. From now on, I will definitely include both of these files in all of my future projects, and I’m really thankful to have learned this skill.



The second key thing I learned was Markdown. I really appreciate learning Markdown because it keeps everything organized in one place. Instead of using different platforms or formats, Markdown allows me to write and structure text neatly and consistently. I believe I will use it a lot in the future because it’s simple yet very powerful for documentation.



When it comes to version control, as I mentioned earlier, I had no experience with it before. But after learning how it works, I think it’s the one I would definitely stick with. It allows me to send all of my work to Git Bash so it can be viewed easily. This is especially helpful for my grading process and for keeping track of my project progress. I can see how version control is extremely useful for both collaboration and organization.



For dependency management and sandboxing tools, I actually found them interesting, but also quite confusing. While I like the idea behind them, I think I’ll try to avoid using them unless it’s absolutely necessary. They seem helpful in controlling project environments, but for now, I find them a bit too complicated and sometimes even frustrating to use.



Regarding RTM (Read The Manual), I think this is something I will use a lot in the future. It’s very helpful and provides useful documentation whenever I get stuck or need clarification. However, I also know that I need to be careful and patient while using it, because understanding technical documentation can sometimes be tricky.



In conclusion, I believe every single one of these tools is helpful in its own way. Although I found some of them confusing at first, I’m confident that they will be very useful in my future projects. This experience has taught me a lot about how to organize, manage, and document my work more effectively. Overall, I’m really thankful for this learning opportunity—it has given me skills that I will carry forward in my future studies and professional work.
